#Java End-to-End PDTB-Styled Discourse Parser


PDTB parser based on:
<cite> Ziheng Lin, Hwee Tou Ng and Min-Yen Kan (2014).<b> A PDTB-Styled End-to-End Discourse Parser </b>. Natural Language Engineering, 20, pp 151-184. Cambridge University Press.</cite>

Version: 2.0.0

Last update: 28-Sep-2015

Requires JDK 1.7 or higher.

## Quick Start

1. `git clone https://github.com/ilija139/PDTB-Parser.git`
2. `cd PDTB-Parser/`
3. `java -jar runnable_jars/parser.jar  text_doc_to_parse.txt` 
4. The PDTB relations are in `tmp/text_doc_to_parse.txt`


## Installing and Usage


1. Clone the repo or download the code by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the right.

2. Extract the zip file.

3. Move the PDTB corpus in a folder `data/pdtb/` or edit the location (requires re-compiling) in sg.edu.nus.comp.pdtb.util.Settings.java. The folder structure should be like: `data/pdtb/$section_number/`, where the section number goes from 00 to 25. 

4. Move the PTB corpus in a folder `data/ptb/` or edit the location (requires re-compiling) in sg.edu.nus.comp.pdtb.util.Settings.java. The folder structure should be like: `data/ptb/parse_tree/$section_number/` and `data/ptb/raw_text/$section_number/`, where the section nubmer goes from 00 to 25.

5. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to PDTB-Parser-master directory.

6. Run `java -jar runnable_jars/SpanTreeExtractor.jar` to generate the auxiliary files used by the parser. 

7a. Run `java -jar Tester.jar` to generate the model files, run the tests and print out the results as reported in the paper.

7b. Run `java -jar Tester.jar -useOldModels` to use the pre-generated model files, run the tests and print out the results. <b>If you use the pre-generated model files, you can skip the previous 4 steps</b>

### Parsing any text

To parse any text document you will need the jar file `runnable_jars/parser.jar` and the model files in the `output` directory. Then run the following command:

`java -jar runnable_jars/parser.jar  text_doc_to_parse.txt` 

The argument `text_doc_to_parse.txt` is a file path to the document you want to parse. The location of the model files is specified in `config.properties` (by default `output`) and it's relative to the directory you are running the above command. 

The parser will output the relations in a pipe file format. This file and the other auxiliary files generated from the text document are stored by default in the `tmp/` directory, but you can specify a different directory in the `config.properties` file. 


## Required Resources

The PDTB and PTB (raw text and parse trees) corpora are required by all of the parser components. 

The NonExplicit component also requires dependency trees for training and testing. They can be generated using the Stanford parser found in `external/auto_parsers` directory. 

By running the `Tester.jar` feature files for all components are re-generated except for the auto+ep case. If you want to re-generate the feature files for this experiment you will have to also re-generate the auto parse trees using the parsers found in `external/auto_parsers` directory.

The directory paths to the these resources are specified in `sg.edu.nus.comp.pdtb.util.Settings` file. 


## Pipe Format

 The parser uses the PDTB pipe-delimited format where every relation is represented
 on a single line and values are delimited by the pipe symbol.
 There must be 48 columns, but certain values may be blank. 
 
 
 The following lists the column values.
 For precise definitions of the terms used, please consult the [PDTB 2.0 annotation manual](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/PDTBAPI/pdtb-annotation-manual.pdf).
