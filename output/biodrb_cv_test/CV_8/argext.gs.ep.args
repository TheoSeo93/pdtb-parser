Insufficiencies of multiple cytokines might be involved in the changes in proliferation and cell death at the CD44-25- and DP stages in Hoxa3-Pax1 compound mutants|the reductions seen in cytokine message levels in the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-compound mutants are not secondary to decreased TEC numbers|Although the number of TECs is reduced by about 2-fold in Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/- compound mutants, the number of thymocytes is reduced by a slightly greater amount, around 3-fold [29|the reductions seen in cytokine message levels in the Hoxa3+/-Pax1-/-compound mutants are not secondary to decreased TEC numbers|20447..20610|20944..21072|20755..20930|20944..21072|130029.txt|20933..20942|PS

Our results show that fetal and adult wild type thymocytes have stage-specific differences in proliferation, with both TN1 and DP cells exhibiting higher levels of proliferation in fetal thymus.
