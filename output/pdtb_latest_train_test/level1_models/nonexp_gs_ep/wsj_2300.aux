Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||6344..6609|55|Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard Grasso ( Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling ) was talking on an " inter-exchange hot line " to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board .||||||||6611..6747|56|He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .|||||||||||||
