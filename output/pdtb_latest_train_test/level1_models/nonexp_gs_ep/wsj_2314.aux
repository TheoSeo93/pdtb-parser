Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1243..1354|10|And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .||||||||1356..1447|11|" We were all wonderful heroes last year , " says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1490..1600|13|At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .||||||||1602..1806|14|Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2052..2196|16|Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .||||||||2198..2279|17|In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2467..2628|19|When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share , provided no other variables are changing .||||||||2630..2739|20|In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2870..2978|22|Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast .||||||||2980..3084|23|That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3088..3180|24|By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year .||||||||3182..3265|25|China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3182..3265|25|China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .||||||||3267..3457|26|Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .|||||||||||||
