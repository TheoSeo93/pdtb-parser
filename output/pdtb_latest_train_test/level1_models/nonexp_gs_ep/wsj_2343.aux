Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4541..4763|32|Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme – the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it .||||||||4766..4987|33|Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan .|||||||||||||
