Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||191..400|1|Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit .||||||||402..539|2|Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||914..1026|5|In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision .||||||||1028..1105|6|House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2292..2474|16|One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .||||||||2476..2532|17|Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2536..2624|18|The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress .||||||||2626..2805|19|Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2809..2913|20|Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill .||||||||2915..2963|21|The House appears reluctant to join the senators .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2915..2963|21|The House appears reluctant to join the senators .||||||||2965..3089|22|A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3324..3399|24|Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks .||||||||3401..3498|25|He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4168..4417|30|One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .||||||||4419..4487|31|Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4792..4953|34|Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , " We 're looking like idiots .||||||||4955..4984|35|Things had just gone too far . "|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||6029..6134|44|The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining .||||||||6136..6452|45|Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill .|||||||||||||
