Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||582..684|6|He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution .||||||||686..755|7|He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||759..880|8|Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth .||||||||882..972|9|He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1247..1326|12|3 . That his " committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD .||||||||1328..1391|13|My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc . "|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1395..1411|14|Absolute rubbish .||||||||1413..1526|15|By any " reasonable man " criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1413..1526|15|By any " reasonable man " criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .||||||||1528..1559|16|Apparently , their verdict is in .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1528..1559|16|Apparently , their verdict is in .||||||||1561..1596|17|Right now they 're pursuing evidence .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1561..1596|17|Right now they 're pursuing evidence .||||||||1598..1686|18|That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1690..1744|19|How was that practice referred to when I was in school ?||||||||1746..1786|20|Ah , yes , something called a Star Chamber .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1790..1894|21|Of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change .||||||||1896..1926|22|No doubt that 's partially true .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1896..1926|22|No doubt that 's partially true .||||||||1928..1991|23|Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1928..1991|23|Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true .||||||||1993..2109|24|He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2111..2226|25|But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ?||||||||2228..2318|26|Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2228..2318|26|Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?||||||||2320..2428|27|Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2320..2428|27|Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?||||||||2430..2475|28|No , Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2668..2802|30|No , to my mind , the Journal did not " defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... "||||||||2804..2880|31|it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2884..3132|32|The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary/judicial body .||||||||3134..3203|33|( Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . )|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3134..3203|33|( Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . )||||||||3205..3256|34|The system is the problem , not an individual member .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3205..3256|34|The system is the problem , not an individual member .||||||||3258..3305|35|Individuals can always have their hands slapped .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3258..3305|35|Individuals can always have their hands slapped .||||||||3307..3367|36|It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3416..3643|38|But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency ( and , yes , maybe criminality ) within HUD could possibly generate .||||||||3645..3745|39|The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when " Tail Gunner Joe " McCarthy did his work .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4002..4136|43|The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person " shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . "||||||||4138..4281|44|This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4610..4790|47|The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that " the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . "||||||||4794..4836|48|Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 ( 1976 ) .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4838..5054|49|Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .||||||||5056..5205|50|He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||5056..5205|50|He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .||||||||5207..5506|51|Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||5207..5506|51|Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .||||||||5508..5587|52|Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||5591..5883|53|Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .||||||||5885..6078|54|The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .|||||||||||||
