Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||687..813|5|Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines .||||||||815..965|6|Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market – and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||815..965|6|Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market – and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 .||||||||968..1068|7|All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1072..1287|8|In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks – perhaps misleadingly .||||||||1290..1389|9|One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1458..1573|11|That ca n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy .||||||||1575..1687|12|Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to " read " block printing .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1832..1858|14|Palmtops are n't far behind .||||||||1860..2105|15|Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2394..2604|18|At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls " the Holy Grail of the computer industry " – the search for " a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere .

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2873..2960|23|Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales .|||||||||24|Laptops – generally anything under 15 pounds – have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3103..3174|25|Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises .||||||||3176..3231|26|Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3609..3784|31|Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small – a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing .||||||||3787..3897|32|Poquet , trying to avoid the " gadget " label , responded with the tag line , " The Poquet PC – a Very Big Computer .

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3902..4011|33|Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises .||||||||4013..4138|34|Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4425..4648|37|Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker .||||||||4650..4794|38|Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales .|||||||||||||
