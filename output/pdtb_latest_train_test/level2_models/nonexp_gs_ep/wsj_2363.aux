Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||203..457|1|Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .||||||||459..582|2|Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||586..886|3|" The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , " and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .||||||||888..1060|4|Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1138..1309|6|Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .||||||||1311..1614|7|The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is " down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , " said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||1618..1763|8|Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .||||||||1765..1915|9|Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2171..2379|11|Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .||||||||2381..2486|12|That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2490..2681|13|Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .||||||||2683..2716|14|" It 's very much a growing concern .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3015..3243|17|Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .||||||||3245..3310|18|The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .|||||||||||||
