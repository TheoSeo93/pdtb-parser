Implicit|||||||||||||||||||||||11|– For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .||||||||1466..1553|12|The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||2429..2541|19|In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash .||||||||2543..2654|20|Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .|||||||||||||

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3282..3381|24|But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year .||||||||3383..3680|25|Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .|||||||||||||
Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||3684..3857|26|One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble .||||||||3859..4000|27|" Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , " Rep.

Implicit||||||||||||||||||||||4653..4870|33|Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight .||||||||4872..5066|34|Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .|||||||||||||
