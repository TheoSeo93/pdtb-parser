Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||11094..11461|56|Binding of anti-CD4 mAbs to separate epitopes of the CD4 molecule could result in differential effects on T-cell functions by inducing distinct conformational changes of the extracellular and the intracellular parts of the CD4 , resulting in modified interaction with other signaling molecules , as has been discussed recently with regard to the aspartate receptor [ 24 ] .||||||||11465..11650|57|In the present study , the ameliorating anti-CD4 mAbs W3/25 and OX35 ( but not the accelerating mAb , RIB5/2 ) numerically/significantly increased the DTH to the arthritogen M. tuberculosis .|||||||||||||

EntRel||||||||||||||||||||||11942..12614|60|The successful mode of action of anti-CD4 mAbs in arthritides may therefore be based on increasing the reactivity of a subpopulation of regulatory T cells , an interpretation that is supported by i ) the increase of T-cell reactivity in some patients successfully treated with anti-CD4 mAbs [ 6 ] , ii ) an increased DTH to antigens like tetanus toxoid in less active versus active rheumatoid arthritis [ 25 ] , iii ) the reduced responsiveness to poly-specific stimulation of spleen cells from rats with acute AA in comparison with healthy animals [ 26 ] , and iv ) the almost complete restoration of T-cell responsiveness upon disease resolution/transition into the chronic phase [ 27 ] .||||||||12618..12829|61|The accelerating mAb RIB5/2 significantly increased the secretion of TNF-α , as observed in primary CD4 + T cells both upon anti-CD4 preincubation and upon CD4 cross-linking after stimulation with TCR ( see Fig. 2 ) .|||||||||||||

Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||13383..13594|64|Since TNF-α production is known to be regulated predominantly by NF-κB [ 34 ] , it was revealing that the accelerating mAb , RIB5/2 , besides inducing TNF-α secretion , also strongly upregulated NF-κB binding activity .||||||||13596..13832|65|This was especially striking because binding of another major transcription factor involved in T-cell activation , AP-1 [ 35 ] , was even slightly downregulated by the anti-CD4 mAbs , in line with recently published data in murine cells [ 36 ] .|||||||||||||
EntRel||||||||||||||||||||||13834..14052|66|These findings in our study support , again , the notion that NF-κB-mediated upregulation of TNF-α secretion ( or vice versa ) may contribute to the acceleration of disease onset in AA upon preventive treatment with RIB5/2 .||||||||14056..14190|67|The differential clinical efficacy of anti-CD4 mAbs is not restricted to arthritis but is also observed in transplantation models [ 37 ] .|||||||||||||
