Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||22664..22776|159|However , Oct proteins are not exclusively expressed in B cells and Oct1 is also found in T cells and fibroblasts .||||||||22778..22975|160|We could show that Oct1 as well Oct2 are able to bind to the murine as well to the human Btk promoter , albeit this binding activity was much weaker than that observed using a consensus octamer site .|||||||||||||

Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||23277..23472|163|Interestingly , whereas in the absence of BOB .1 / OBF .1 only a weak binding of Oct factors was observed , the ternary complex formation was found similar to that formed on the consensus octamer motif .||||||||23476..23601|164|Similar results were observed when the Oct-dependent and BOB .1 / OBF.1-dependent osteopontin promoter had been analyzed ( 61,62 ) .|||||||||||||
