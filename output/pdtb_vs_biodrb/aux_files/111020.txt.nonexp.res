Implicit|||||||||||Expansion|||||||||||13383..13594|64|Since TNF-α production is known to be regulated predominantly by NF-κB [ 34 ] , it was revealing that the accelerating mAb , RIB5/2 , besides inducing TNF-α secretion , also strongly upregulated NF-κB binding activity .||||||||13596..13832|65|This was especially striking because binding of another major transcription factor involved in T-cell activation , AP-1 [ 35 ] , was even slightly downregulated by the anti-CD4 mAbs , in line with recently published data in murine cells [ 36 ] .|||||||||||||
